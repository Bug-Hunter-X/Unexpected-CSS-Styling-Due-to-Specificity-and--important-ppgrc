# Unexpected CSS Styling Due to Specificity and !important

This repository demonstrates a subtle CSS issue related to specificity and the `!important` flag. The problem arises from the interaction of the cascade, selector specificity, and the `!important` declaration, causing unexpected styling behavior.

## Bug Description
The CSS code includes styles for `h1` and `p` elements within a specific container.  The `p` element includes styling with the `!important` flag. However, due to specificity rules, the `!important` declaration does not override the more specific selector.

## Solution
The solution involves understanding and managing CSS specificity. In this case, adjusting the selectors to avoid conflicts or using a more specific selector for the desired style solves the issue.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Observe that the `p` element's styling is not as expected.
